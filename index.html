							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>The Philippines has long been riddled by persistent social issues such as poverty, unemployment, crime, and political violence, among others. Different administrations have attempted to resolve these issues through varying strategies and efforts. Economic indicators serve as crucial metrics for assessing the performance of government leaders in addressing the financial concerns and state of the country. Moreover, we believe that strengthening financial institutions would enhance the delivery of essential services to citizens, thereby alleviating hardships in areas such as healthcare, employment, and education. Consequently, this could mitigate the necessity for protests to advocate for these rights, leading to increased citizen satisfaction.</p>

							<h3>Problem</h3>
							<p>Political violence in the Philippines is a multifaceted issue fueled by various social, economic, and political factors. 
							Stemming from deep-seated social inequalities, dissatisfaction with government performance, and economic instability, 
							it manifests as a means for marginalized communities to voice grievances and demand change. Economic hardship exacerbates 
							tensions, while inadequate government services compound citizen dissatisfaction, creating unrest. Addressing these root causes 
							necessitates comprehensive strategies that prioritize social justice, economic development, and good governance.</p>

							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>Utilizing data science techniques, we propose a solution that aims to identify correlations between economic indicators and political violence in the Philippines. By analyzing datasets of recorded political violence and economic indicators in the Philippines, we will uncover key factors influencing the occurrence of political violence and develop predictive models to anticipate its likelihood based on economic changes. These insights will empower policymakers to implement targeted interventions, fostering social stability and inclusive development.

						<h1>Background Study</h1>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>Carothers and Feldman (2022) illuminated the global landscape of protests, with a particular focus on the pervasive influence of economic grievances as drivers of social unrest. The widespread surge in protests driven by rising citizen anger over economic problems, notably surging inflation, has led to an increase in antigovernment demonstrations worldwide. They also emphasized that while economic protests were prevalent across various regions, they often manifested under different banners, such as labor unions or political parties, advocating for greater government intervention to address underlying economic challenges. Furthermore, they note the short-lived nature of many economic protests, suggesting a lack of clear solutions and the complexity of economic disruptions.</p>

					<h1>Data</h1>
					<h4>We looked at publicly available and credible databanks.</h4>
					<p>Specifically, we looked at ACLED by using their <a href="https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/" target="_blank">data export tool</a>,
						and we looked at World Bank's data catalog labeled as <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037798/Global-Economic-Monitor" target="_blank">Global Economic Monitor.</a></p>
				</header>
				<p>The dataset includes political violence in the Philippines from 2016 up to the present, which
					amounts. Each data point records pertinent information on
					the nature of the political violence: date, time, location, fatalities, and many more.
