                        Welcome to our project, <strong style="color: #490C0C;">Analyzing Economic Indicators and Political Violence in the Philippines</strong>, part of the dynamic initiative "PiNut 2023: Pilipinas in a Nutshell." 
                        Through the application of Data Science concepts to real-world data, we are committed to extracting actionable insights and addressing significant challenges. 
                        Aligned with <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</a>, our work aims to foster societal betterment within the Philippines.

						<h4 class="title">Motivation</h4>
						<p class="description">
							The Philippines has long been riddled by persistent social issues such as poverty, unemployment, crime, and political violence, among others.
							Different administrations have attempted to resolve these issues through varying strategies and efforts.
							Economic indicators serve as crucial metrics for assessing the performance of government leaders in addressing the financial concerns and state of the country.
							Moreover, we believe that strengthening financial institutions would enhance the delivery of essential services to citizens, thereby alleviating hardships in areas such as healthcare, employment, and education.
							Consequently, this could mitigate the necessity for protests to advocate for these rights, leading to increased citizen satisfaction.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-box col-4">
						<h4 class="title">Problem</h4>
						<p class="description">
							Political violence in the Philippines is a multifaceted issue fueled by various social, economic, and political factors. 
							Stemming from deep-seated social inequalities, dissatisfaction with government performance, and economic instability, 
							it manifests as a means for marginalized communities to voice grievances and demand change. Economic hardship exacerbates 
							tensions, while inadequate government services compound citizen dissatisfaction, creating unrest. Addressing these root causes 
							necessitates comprehensive strategies that prioritize social justice, economic development, and good governance.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-box col-4">
						<h4 class="title">Solution</h4>
						<p class="description">
							Our project employs advanced data science techniques to explore the relationship between economic indicators and political violence in the Philippines.
                            Through analysis of comprehensive datasets on political violence and economic metrics, we aim to uncover key drivers and develop predictive models to
                            anticipate outbreaks based on economic shifts. These insights will equip policymakers with targeted strategies to foster stability and inclusive development,
                            mitigating the underlying causes of political violence.

					<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
				</header>
				<span>
					<p>We have done the following steps to perform Exploratory Data Analysis in our dataset and learn about the relationships between the dataset features using time-series spearman cross-correlation with time-lag:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Import data sets with <code>Philippines</code> column filter for economic indicators: 
							</strong>
							Since the dataset used includes other countries that are not part of the scope of our research, we filtered out entries of countries other than <code>Philippines</code>.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Rename columns for the economic indicators using the name of the economic indicators themselves:  
							</strong>
							Each economic indicator datasets has country names as column names, with file name as the economic indicator itself. Since we obtained the <code>Philippines</code> column for each economic indicator dataset, we replaced the said column with the name of the economic indicator since the country column name is of no use anymore.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Create inferred column <code>date</code> in the ACLED dataset before merging:
							</strong>
							Prior to joining the economic indicator datasets with the ACLED dataset, we created an inferred column named <code>date</code> in the ACLED dataset that conforms to the format in the economic indicator datasets. This would prove useful upon merging the datasets as we used the <code>date</code> column as the key for merging.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Preprocess imported GDP economic indicator dataframes using monthly frequency before merging:
							</strong>
							The GDP economic indicator dataset has quarterly frequency which makes the date formats in quarterly format, non-conformant to other economic indicator datasets that use monthly frequency for date. Hence, we preprocessed the GDP economic indicator dataset in which for each quarter, we duplicated the GDP value entries and then transformed the date entries of these duplicate entries into months of the corresponding quarter.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Create aggregated economic indicator dataframe for merging:
							</strong>
							We aggregated the economic indicator datasets into one large economic indicator dataset.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Join economic indicator dataframes into the ACLED dataframe as the main dataframe:
							</strong>
							We performed dataset merge on the date values of the aggregated economic indicator dataset and the ACLED dataset.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Set <code>Date</code> format to <code>Timestamp</code> for date ordinality:
							</strong>
							For plotting ordinality purposes, we set the format of the <code>Date</code> column of the aggregated dataset to <code>Timestamp</code>.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Line plot of the number of recorded political violence incidents over time:
							</strong>
							With the properly-formatted aggregated dataset on hand, we inspect the number of recorded political violence incidents over time using a line plot. Refer to the <a href="#plots">Plots</a> section for the generated line plot.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Line plot of the economic indicators over time:
							</strong>
							In addition, we inspect the trend of economic indicators over time using a line plot. Refer to the <a href="#plots">Plots</a> section for the generated line plots.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Create a new dataframe from the main dataframe with time lags:
							</strong>
							To utilize time-series spearman cross-correlation with time-lag for analysis, we have to create a new dataset that introduces shifted values for each feature as time lags.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Compute the correlation matrix using spearman cross-correlation and obtain relevant data:
							</strong>
							Using the <code>corr()</code> function from <code>pandas</code>, we compute the spearman cross-correlation matrix for the aggregated dataset with time-lag. Note that we used the spearman correlation method since we are working with economic data that display various patterns that suggest non-linear yet monotonic relationships.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Obtain correlation submatrices for each economic indicator to the amount of political violence incidents:
							</strong>
							We truncated the resulting spearman cross-correlation matrix so that we can conveniently analyze relevant correlations (i.e., cross-correlations across each economic indicator and amount of political violence incidents). Hence, cross-correlations across economic indicators only are removed.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Generate heatmaps for the correlation matrices of the relevant data and store to local storage:
							</strong>
							We used the heatmap display from <code>seaborn</code> to properly display the resulting correlation matrices.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<strong>
								Find the maxima of the positive and negative time-lag cross-correlations for each economic indicator:
							</strong>
							To help us in answering our research questions, we found the maxima of the positive and negative time-lag cross-correlations for each economic indicator as follows:

					<h1>Conclusions</h1>
					<h4>Is there a correlation between the Philippines's economic indicators (PHP exchange rate, internal debt, foreign investment, GDP, GNI, etc.) and the number of recorded political violence in the country?</h4>
					<h5>Yes</h5>
					<p>
						In particular, most of the indicators displayed moderate amounts (<code>0.4</code> to <code>0.8</code>), yet some only displayed weak to no correlation (<code>0</code> to less than <code>0.4</code>), in particular Foreign Reserves, Industrial Production, Nominal Effective Exchange Rate, and Unemployment Rate.
						CPI Price and GDP at market prices displayed a strong correlation (greater than <code>0.8</code>), although both of them are negative correlations. Terms of Trade has strongest positive correlation.
					</p>
					<h4>Which economic indicator is most correlated with the number of recorded political violence occurred in the Philippines?</h4>
					<h5>Terms of Trade and CPI</h5>	
					<p>
						Terms of trade displayed the strongest positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of <code>0.66</code>.
						Meanwhile, CPI Price displayed the strongest negative correlation with a correlation coefficient of <code>-0.84</code>.
