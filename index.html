                        Welcome to our project, <strong style="color: #490C0C;">Analyzing Economic Indicators and Political Violence in the Philippines</strong>, part of the dynamic initiative "PiNut 2023: Pilipinas in a Nutshell." 
                        Through the application of Data Science concepts to real-world data, we are committed to extracting actionable insights and addressing significant challenges. 
                        Aligned with <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</a>, our work aims to foster societal betterment within the Philippines.

						<h4 class="title">Motivation</h4>
						<p class="description">
							The Philippines has long been riddled by persistent social issues such as poverty, unemployment, crime, and political violence, among others.
							Different administrations have attempted to resolve these issues through varying strategies and efforts.
							Economic indicators serve as crucial metrics for assessing the performance of government leaders in addressing the financial concerns and state of the country.
							Moreover, we believe that strengthening financial institutions would enhance the delivery of essential services to citizens, thereby alleviating hardships in areas such as healthcare, employment, and education.
							Consequently, this could mitigate the necessity for protests to advocate for these rights, leading to increased citizen satisfaction.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-box col-4">
						<h4 class="title">Problem</h4>
						<p class="description">
							Political violence in the Philippines is a multifaceted issue fueled by various social, economic, and political factors. 
							Stemming from deep-seated social inequalities, dissatisfaction with government performance, and economic instability, 
							it manifests as a means for marginalized communities to voice grievances and demand change. Economic hardship exacerbates 
							tensions, while inadequate government services compound citizen dissatisfaction, creating unrest. Addressing these root causes 
							necessitates comprehensive strategies that prioritize social justice, economic development, and good governance.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-box col-4">
						<h4 class="title">Solution</h4>
						<p class="description">
							Our project employs advanced data science techniques to explore the relationship between economic indicators and political violence in the Philippines.
                            Through analysis of comprehensive datasets on political violence and economic metrics, we aim to uncover key drivers and develop predictive models to
                            anticipate outbreaks based on economic shifts. These insights will equip policymakers with targeted strategies to foster stability and inclusive development,
                            mitigating the underlying causes of political violence.

							<h4>We looked at publicly available and credible databanks.</h4>
							<p>Specifically, we looked at ACLED by using their <a href="https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/" target="_blank">data export tool</a>,
								and we looked at World Bank's data catalog labeled as <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037798/Global-Economic-Monitor" target="_blank">Global Economic Monitor.</a></p>
						</header>
						<p>The dataset includes political violence in the Philippines from 2016 up to the present, which
							amounts. Each data point records pertinent information on
							the nature of the political violence: date, time, location, fatalities, and many more.

					<h1>Results</h1>
					<h4>Is there a correlation between the Philippines's economic indicators (PHP exchange rate, internal debt, foreign investment, GDP, GNI, etc.) and the number of recorded political violence in the country?</h4>
					<h5>Yes</h5>
					<p>
						In particular, most of the indicators displayed moderate amounts (0.4-0.8), yet some only displayed weak to no correlation (0 to <=0.4), in particular Exports Merchandise, Foreign Reserves, Industrial Production, and Unemployment Rate.
						None displayed a strong correlation.
					</p>
					<h4>Which economic indicator is most correlated with the number of recorded political violence occurred in the Philippines?</h4>
					<h5>Terms of Trade and CPI</h5>	
					<p>
						Terms of trade displayed the strongest positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.65.
						Meanwhile, CPI Price displayed the strongest negative correlation with a correlation coefficient of -0.74.
